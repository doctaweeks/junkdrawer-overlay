#Gentoo junkdrawer overlay

A Gentoo overlay with a random assortment of development tools, libraries, and
patches not in the Gentoo tree (yet).

Much of the motivation for this overlay was in breaking apart packages that
insisted on including other projects in their source tree or build system. If a
tool or library *can* be shared system-wide it *should* be!
