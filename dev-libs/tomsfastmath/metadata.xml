	In a nutshell TomsFastMath is meant to be a portable fixed precision math
	library geared towards doing one thing very fast. Exponentiations. The
	modular kind. Like what you find in RSA and DH. Though TomsFastMath (TFM)
	is not limited solely to doing RSA or DH. It's generic enough to be used
	for other projects such as ECC as well.
