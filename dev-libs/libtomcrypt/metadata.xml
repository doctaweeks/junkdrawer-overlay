	LibTomCrypt is a fairly comprehensive, modular and portable cryptographic
	toolkit that provides developers with a vast array of well known published
	block ciphers, one-way hash functions, chaining modes, pseudo-random number
	generators, public key cryptography and a plethora of other routines.

	LibTomCrypt has been designed from the ground up to be very simple to use.
	It has a modular and standard API that allows new ciphers, hashes and PRNGs
	to be added or removed without change to the overall end application. It
	features easy to use functions and a complete user manual which has many
	source snippet examples.

	LibTomCrypt is free for all purposes under the public domain. This includes
	commercial use, redistribution and even branching.
