    LibTomCrypt is a fairly comprehensive, modular and portable cryptographic toolkit 
    that provides developers with a vast array of well known published block ciphers, 
    one-way hash functions, chaining modes, pseudo-random number generators, public 
    key cryptography and a plethora of other routines.

    LibTomCrypt has been designed from the ground up to be very simple to use. It has 
    a modular and standard API that allows new ciphers, hashes and PRNGs to be added 
    or removed without change to the overall end application. It features easy to use 
    functions and a complete user manual which has many source snippet examples.

    LibTomCrypt is free for all purposes under the public domain. This includes 
    commercial use, redistribution and even branching.

    Sports the following algorithms

      * Block Ciphers
            o Blowfish
            o XTEA
            o RC5

            o SAFER+
            o Rijndael (aka AES)
            o Twofish
            o SAFER (K64, SK64, K128, SK128)
            o RC2
            o DES, 3DES
            o CAST5
            o Noekeon
            o Skipjack 
      * Chaining Modes
            o ECB
            o CBC
            o OFB
            o CFB
            o CTR 
      * One-Way Hash Functions

            o SHA-1
            o SHA-224/256/384/512
            o TIGER-192
            o RIPE-MD 128/160 
      * Message Authentication
            o FIPS-198 HMAC (supports all hashes)
            o FIPS pending OMAC1 (supports all ciphers) 
      * Message Encrypt+Authenticate Modes
            o EAX Mode
            o OCB Mode 
      * Pseudo-Random Number Generators
            o Yarrow (based algorithm)
            o RC4
            o Support for /dev/random, /dev/urandom and the Win32 CSP RNG 
      * Public Key Algorithms
            o RSA (using PKCS #1 v1.5 style padding)
            o DH (using ElGamal signatures and simple DH encryption)
            o ECC (over Z/pZ, ElGamal Signatures, simple DH style encryption)
            o DSA (Users make their own groups)
